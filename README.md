# Calorie-Tracker-Project
Calorie Tracker website I created for my Software Engineer and Practice course.
To begin this project, I downloaded xampp.
Start Apache and MySql.
I used vscode to code the php, html, css, and javascript used in this project.
I created a database called calorie tracker using phpmyadmin.
I created three tables: loginsystem, dailyInput, goals.
I created a php file for my project called database.php that creates a connection with the database, and allowed me to interact with the database in my other files.
I added a fully working sign up and log in system to the website. The site changes depending on if you're signed in or not.
User can use the tracker, and view their input in the progress page.
Progress Page also displays the user's current goals and allows them to update them.
Dashboard shows the users current goals and a graph of the last 7 days they tracked their calories.
The result was a fully functioning calorie tracking system.
